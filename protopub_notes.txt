Protopub (protocol buffers)
---------------------------
---------------------------

This is different way of pojo
We can serialize or deserialize using class which is created by proto compiler
We can use for client server communication. Instead of json we can use this.



We can define required params/object/schema in any filename.proto
Then we can create class from that proto file using protoc (using proto compiler).
We can create class of any language using the proto compiler
Then we can use that class in our project

---

To download compiler go to below link
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/

Click on latest release
download protoc for our system. Eg: protoc-3.19.3-win64.zip

Then extract/install in system

If need add installed bin path to environment variable, so that we can use protoc in any directory

Thats it

Sample proto file:

Eg: user.proto

message User {
  required string name = 1;
  optional int64 age = 2;
}


//give number for each param. Each number should be unique and increasing order. should start from 1. Here i have given 1 for name and 2 for age.


Once created, give below command to create class. //Here I wanted to create java class from proto

protoc java_out=pathWhereTheJavaClassIsNeeded filenameWithPath

Eg:
protoc java_out=. user.proto       

Above will create class file fron proto file using protoc


-----------


Way to write proto file:
It should be like schema

Eg:

syntax = "proto3"         //use version in syntax. I have given latest version proto3

message Employee {        //message is like class. 
  int32 id = 1;          //here it has datatype variable name and sequence number
  string name = 2;
  float salary = 3;
}

message Employees {        //here list/array of employee is inside this 
  repeated Employee employees = 1;     //For defining array/list use repeated. here i have given list of Employee in variable name employees
}


----

It can be converted to any language
